\chapter*{Abstract}
In recent years with more and more computational power and sophisticated algorithms, autonomous cars are close to becoming a reality. An ancillary effect of this development is the emerging of driverless racecars. For this idea to become a reality, three key ingredients have to be met. A very good approximation of the location of the racecar in a virtual map, a trajectory planning algorithm and a controller that will drive the car on the computed path. In this thesis the model predictive control(MPC) algorithm is used, to combine the trajectory planning and controlling for an autonomous race car, build for the formula student driverless competition. A simulation environment will be developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. One key part of this thesis is to investigate how prone to model errors the MPC-approach is and what performance can be expected for the use of a kinetic bicycle model as system description in the (MPC)-algorithm.
